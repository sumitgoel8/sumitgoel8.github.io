    <h2>BIO</h2>
    <p>I will be a Post-Doctoral Associate at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) starting Fall 2023. Previously, I obtained my PhD in Social Sciences from California Institute of Technology and MS in Quantitative Economics from Indian Statistical Institute (Delhi). 
    My research interests lie in the field of microeconomic theory, with a focus on mechanism design and social choice.

          	<p class="abstract" id="abstract-1">We consider contests where participants have private information about their ability and the contest designer can manipulate the values of different prizes to influence effort. We study the effect on effort of two different interventions: increase in the value of prizes and increase in competition (transfer of value from worse to better prizes). We identify two natural sufficient conditions on the distribution of abilities in the population under which both interventions have opposite effects on effort. More precisely, we find that if the density of agents is decreasing in ability so that unproductive agents are more likely than productive agents, the two interventions encourage effort. And if this density is monotone increasing in ability, the interventions discourage effort. We discuss applications to the design of optimal contests in three different environments, including the design of grading contests. Assuming the value of a grade is determined by the information it reveals about the agent's ability, we establish a link between the informativeness of a grading scheme and the effort induced by it.

          	<p class="abstract" id="abstract-2">We study discrete allocation problems, as in the textbook notion of an exchange economy, but with indivisible goods. The problem is well-known to be difficult. The model is rich enough to encode some of the most pathological bargaining configurations in game theory, like the roommate problem. Our contribution is to show the existence of stable allocations (outcomes in the weak core, or in the bargaining set) under different sets of assumptions. Specifically, we consider dichotomous preferences, categorical economies, and discrete TU markets. The paper uses varied techniques, from Scarf's balanced games to a generalization of the TTC algorithm by means of Tarski fixed points.

          	<p class="abstract" id="abstract-3">We consider a principal agent project selection problem with asymmetric information. There are N projects and the principal must select exactly one of them. Each project provides some profit to the principal and some payoff to the agent and these profits and payoffs are the agent's private information. We consider the principal's problem of finding an optimal mechanism for two different objectives: maximizing expected profit and maximizing the probability of choosing the most profitable project. Importantly, we assume partial verifiability so that the agent cannot report a project to be more profitable to the principal than it actually is. Under this no-overselling constraint, we characterize the set of implementable mechanisms. Using this characterization, we find that in the case of two projects, the optimal mechanism under both objectives takes the form of a simple cutoff mechanism. The simple structure of the optimal mechanism also allows us to find evidence in support of the well-known ally-principle which says that principal delegates more authority to an agent who shares their preferences.

          	<p> <b> Optimal tie-breaking rules </b><br>
          	(with Amit Goyal)<br>
          	Accepted at <i>Journal of Mathematical Economics</i><br>

          	<button id="button-5" onclick="toggleAbstract(5)">Abstract +</button> <button><a href="files/tie_break.pdf">PDF</a></button>

          	<p class="abstract" id="abstract-5">We consider two-player contests with the possibility of ties and study the effect of different tie-breaking rules on effort. For ratio-form and difference-form contests that admit pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, we find that the effort of both players is monotone decreasing in the probability that ties are broken in favor of the stronger player. Thus, the effort-maximizing tie-breaking rule commits to breaking ties in favor of the weaker agent. With symmetric agents, we find that the equilibrium is generally symmetric and independent of the tie-breaking rule. We also study the design of random tie-breaking rules that are unbiased ex-ante and identify sufficient conditions under which breaking ties before the contest actually leads to greater expected effort than the more commonly observed practice of breaking ties after the contest.

          	<p class="abstract" id="abstract-4">We consider the facility location problem in two dimensions. In particular, we consider a setting where agents have Euclidean preferences, defined by their ideal points, for a facility to be located in \(\mathbb{R}^2\).  We show that for the  p-norm (\(p \geq 1\)) objective, the coordinate-wise median mechanism (CM) has the lowest worst-case  approximation ratio  in the class of deterministic, anonymous, and strategyproof mechanisms. For the minisum objective and an odd number of agents \(n\), we show that CM has a worst-case approximation ratio (AR) of \(\sqrt{2}\frac{\sqrt{n^2+1}}{n+1}\). For the p-norm social cost objective (\(p\geq 2\)),  we find that the AR for CM is bounded above by \(2^{\frac{3}{2}-\frac{2}{p}}\). We conjecture that the AR of CM actually equals the lower bound \(2^{1-\frac{1}{p}}\) (as is the case for \(p=2\) and \(p=\infty\)) for any \(p\geq 2\).
