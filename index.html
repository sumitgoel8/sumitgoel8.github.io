  			<p>We study discrete allocation problems, as in the textbook notion of an exchange economy, but with indivisible goods. The problem is well-known to be difficult. The model is rich enough to encode some of the most pathological bargaining configurations in game theory, like the roommate problem. Our contribution is to show the existence of stable allocations (outcomes in the weak core, or in the bargaining set) under different sets of assumptions. Specifically, we consider dichotomous preferences, categorical economies, and discrete TU markets. The paper uses varied techniques, from Scarf's balanced games to a generalization of the TTC algorithm by means of Tarski fixed points.</p>

          <b>Project selection with partially verifiable information</b> [<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00907">arXiv</a>] <br>

  			<p>We consider a problem where the principal chooses a project from a set of available projects for the agent to work on. Each project provides some profit to the principal and some payoff to the agent and these profits and payoffs are the agent's private information. The principal has a belief over these values and his problem is to find an incentive compatible mechanism without using transfers that maximizes expected profit. Importantly, we assume partial verifiability so that the agent cannot report a project to be more profitable to the principal than it actually is. In this setup, we find a neat characterization of the set of incentive compatible mechanisms. Using this characterization, we find the optimal mechanism for the principal when there are two projects. Within a subclass of incentive compatible mechanisms, we show that a single cutoff mechanism is optimal and conjecture that it is the optimal incentive compatible mechanism..</p>

          <b>Optimality of the coordinate-wise median mechanism for strategyproof facility location in two dimensions</b> [<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00903">arXiv</a>]<br>
          (with Wade Hann-Caruthers)<br>

  			<p>We consider the facility location problem in two dimensions. In particular, we consider a setting where agents have Euclidean preferences, defined by their ideal points, for a facility to be located in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$. For the minisum objective and an odd number of agents, we show that the coordinate-wise median mechanism (CM) has a worst-case approximation ratio (AR) of $$\sqrt{2}\frac{\sqrt{n^2+1}}{n+1}$$. Further, we show that CM has the lowest AR for this objective in the class of deterministic, anonymous, and strategyproof mechanisms. For the p-norm social welfare objective, we find that the AR for CM is bounded above by $$2^{\frac{3}{2}-\frac{2}{p}}$$ for $$p\geq 2$$. Since any deterministic strategyproof mechanism must have AR at least $$2^{1-\frac{1}{p}}$$ (Feigenbaum et al. (2017)), our upper bound suggests that the CM is (at worst) very nearly optimal. We conjecture that the approximation ratio of coordinate-wise median is actually equal to the lower bound $$2^{1-\frac{1}{p}}$$ (as is the case for $$p=2$$ and $$p=\infty$$) for any $$p\geq 2$$.</p>
