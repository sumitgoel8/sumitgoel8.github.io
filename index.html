    <h2>BIO</h2>
    <p>I am a Post-Doctoral Associate in the Division of Social Sciences at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD). Previously, I obtained my PhD in Social Sciences from California Institute of Technology and MS in Quantitative Economics from Indian Statistical Institute (Delhi). 
    My research interests lie in the field of microeconomic theory, with a focus on mechanism design, contest design, matching, and social choice.

          	<p class="abstract" id="abstract-7">We study the classical contest design problem of allocating a budget across different prizes to maximize effort in an incomplete information environment with a finite type-space. 
          	For any contest with an arbitrary finite type-space and distribution over this type-space, we characterize the unique symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium of the contest game. We find that the equilibrium is in mixed strategies, where agents of different types mix over disjoint but connected intervals, 
          	so that more efficient agents always exert greater effort than less efficient agents. Using this characterization, we solve for the expected equilibrium effort under any arbitrary contest, and find that with linear costs, a winner-takes-all contest maximizes expected effort among all contests feasible for a budget-constrained designer. 
          	Our analysis introduces new techniques for the study of contests in a finite type-space and offers a unified approach to studying contest design simultaneously in the complete information environment, where the type-space is a singleton, and in the classical incomplete information setting with a continuum type-space, which we show can be well approximated by a sufficiently large finite type-space.

          	<p class="abstract" id="abstract-6">We study a contract design problem between a principal and multiple agents. Each agent participates in an independent task, in which it may exert costly effort towards improving its probability of success, and the principal has a fixed budget which it can use to provide outcome-dependent rewards to the agents. 
          	Assuming the principal cares only about maximizing the agents' probabilities of success, and not how much of the budget it expends, we characterize the Pareto frontier of success probability profiles that can be implemented in Nash equilibrium as equilibria of successful-get-everything contracts. An immediate consequence of this result is that piece-rate contracts and bonus-pool contracts, two types of contracts which are well-studied and motivated in the literature on multi-agent contract design, are never optimal in this setting. 
          	We then identify a natural subclass called priority-based weighted contracts which we show is actually sufficient to implement the Pareto frontier, thus providing a significant reduction in the dimensionality of the principal's optimal contract design problem. Finally, we solve the design problem for the special case with two agents and quadratic costs where our results suggest that the structure of the optimal contract depends primarily on the bias in the principal's objective and is, to some extent, robust to the heterogeneity in the agents' cost functions.

          	<p class="abstract" id="abstract-5">We study the design of grading contests between agents with private information about their abilities under the assumption that the value of a grade is determined by the information it reveals about the agentâ€™s productivity. Towards the goal of identifying the effort-maximizing grading contest, we study the effect of increasing prizes and increasing competition on effort and find that the effects depend qualitatively on the distribution of abilities in the population. Consequently, while the optimal grading contest always uniquely identifies the best performing agent, it may want to pool or separate the remaining agents depending upon the distribution. We identify sufficient conditions under which a rank-revealing grading contest, a leaderboard-with-cutoff type grading contest, and a coarse grading contest with at most three grades are optimal. In the process, we also identify distributions under which there is a monotonic relationship between the informativeness of a grading scheme and the effort induced by it.

          	<p class="abstract" id="abstract-3">We study a principal-agent project selection problem with asymmetric information. The principal must choose exactly one of $N$ projects, each defined by the utility it provides to the principal and to the agent. The agent knows all the utilities, and the principal can commit to a mechanism (without transfers) that maps the agent's report about the utilities to a chosen project. Unlike the typical literature, which assumes the agent can lie arbitrarily, we examine the principal's problem under partial verifiability constraints. We characterize the class of truthful mechanisms under a family of partial verifiability constraints and study the principal's problem for the specific cases of no-overselling and no-underselling. Our results suggest significant benefits for the principal from identifying or inducing such partial verifiability constraints, while also highlighting the simple mechanisms that perform well.

          	<p class="abstract" id="abstract-4">We study stable allocations in an exchange economy with indivisible goods. The problem is well-known to be challenging, and rich enough to encode fundamentally unstable economies, such as the roommate problem. Our approach stems from generalizing the original study of an exchange economy with unit demand and unit endowments, the housing model. Our first approach uses Scarf's theorem, and proposes sufficient conditions under which a ``convexify then round'' technique ensures that the core is nonempty. The upshot is that a core allocation exists in categorical economies with dichotomous preferences. Our second approach uses a generalization of the TTC: it works under general conditions, and finds a solution that is a version of the stable set.

          	<p class="abstract" id="abstract-2">We consider two-player contests with the possibility of ties and study the effect of different tie-breaking rules on effort. For ratio-form and difference-form contests that admit pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, we find that the effort of both players is monotone decreasing in the probability that ties are broken in favor of the stronger player. Thus, the effort-maximizing tie-breaking rule commits to breaking ties in favor of the weaker agent. With symmetric agents, we find that the equilibrium is generally symmetric and independent of the tie-breaking rule. We also study the design of random tie-breaking rules that are unbiased ex-ante and identify sufficient conditions under which breaking ties before the contest actually leads to greater expected effort than the more commonly observed practice of breaking ties after the contest.

          	<p class="abstract" id="abstract-1">We consider the facility location problem in two dimensions. In particular, we consider a setting where agents have Euclidean preferences, defined by their ideal points, for a facility to be located in \(\mathbb{R}^2\).  We show that for the  p-norm (\(p \geq 1\)) objective, the coordinate-wise median mechanism (CM) has the lowest worst-case  approximation ratio  in the class of deterministic, anonymous, and strategyproof mechanisms. For the minisum objective and an odd number of agents \(n\), we show that CM has a worst-case approximation ratio (AR) of \(\sqrt{2}\frac{\sqrt{n^2+1}}{n+1}\). For the p-norm social cost objective (\(p\geq 2\)),  we find that the AR for CM is bounded above by \(2^{\frac{3}{2}-\frac{2}{p}}\). We conjecture that the AR of CM actually equals the lower bound \(2^{1-\frac{1}{p}}\) (as is the case for \(p=2\) and \(p=\infty\)) for any \(p\geq 2\).
