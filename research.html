	<div id="discrete" class="collapse">
  	<p class="mt-2">We study discrete allocation problems, as in the textbook notion of an exchange economy, but with indivisible goods. The problem is well-known to be difficult. The model is rich enough to encode some of the most pathological bargaining configurations in game theory, like the roommate problem. Our contribution is to show the existence of stable allocations (outcomes in the weak core, or in the bargaining set) under different sets of assumptions. Specifically, we consider dichotomous preferences, categorical economies, and discrete TU markets. The paper uses varied techniques, from Scarf's balanced games to a generalization of the TTC algorithm by means of Tarski fixed points.</p>

  	<p class="mt-2">We consider a principal agent project selection problem with asymmetric information. There are N projects and the principal must select exactly one of them. Each project provides some profit to the principal and some payoff to the agent and these profits and payoffs are the agent's private information. We consider the principal's problem of finding an optimal mechanism for two different objectives: maximizing expected profit and maximizing the probability of choosing the most profitable project. Importantly, we assume partial verifiability so that the agent cannot report a project to be more profitable to the principal than it actually is. Under this no-overselling constraint, we characterize the set of implementable mechanisms. Using this characterization, we find that in the case of two projects, the optimal mechanism under both objectives takes the form of a simple cutoff mechanism. The simple structure of the optimal mechanism also allows us to find evidence in support of the well-known ally-principle which says that principal delegates more authority to an agent who shares their preferences.</p>

  	<p class=mt-2>We consider the facility location problem in two dimensions. In particular, we consider a setting where agents have Euclidean preferences, defined by their ideal points, for a facility to be located in \(\mathbb{R}^2\). For the minisum objective and an odd number of agents, we show that the coordinate-wise median mechanism (CM) has a worst-case approximation ratio (AR) of \(\sqrt{2}\frac{\sqrt{n^2+1}}{n+1}\). Further, we show that CM has the lowest AR for this objective in the class of deterministic, anonymous, and strategyproof mechanisms. For the p-norm social welfare objective, we find that the AR for CM is bounded above by \(2^{\frac{3}{2}-\frac{2}{p}}\) for \(p\geq 2\). Since any deterministic strategyproof mechanism must have AR at least \(2^{1-\frac{1}{p}}\) (Feigenbaum et al. (2017)), our upper bound suggests that the CM is (at worst) very nearly optimal. We conjecture that the approximation ratio of coordinate-wise median is actually equal to the lower bound \(2^{1-\frac{1}{p}}\) (as is the case for \(p=2\) and \(p=\infty\)) for any \(p\geq 2\).</p>
